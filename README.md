### Getting Started

Ensure you are using node version 14.19.0 and npm version 6.14.6. To manage different versions of node, we recommend using a [node version manager](https://github.com/tj/n)
Move to the branch `portal-ui` and install the dependencies. Once completed, navigate to `modules/components` and follow the README there for setup and development guides.
