### Getting Started

Ensure you are using node version `14.19.0` and npm version `6.14.6`. To manage different versions of node, we recommend using a [node version manager](https://github.com/tj/n)
Move to the branch `portal-ui` for the latest front end code and install the dependencies from the root folder. 

Once completed, navigate to `modules/components` and follow the README there for setup and development guides.
